# My approach to the [Exactly Finance challenge](https://github.com/exactly-finance/challenge)

The project is divided into two sections: `Smart Contracts` & `Frontend`.

> The challenge does not explicitly require a frontend, however I've decided to add it anwyway as an extra learning experience for myself.

## 🧙‍♂️ Tech used

-   `Smart Contracts`:
    -   Solidity - _Smart Contracts_
    -   ETH-Brownie - _Development Framework_
-   `Frontend`
    -   React - _UI Framework_
    -   Ethers.js - _Web3 Library_
