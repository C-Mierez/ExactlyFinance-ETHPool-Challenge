# My approach to the [Exactly Finance challenge](https://github.com/exactly-finance/challenge)

The project is divided into two sections: `Smart Contracts` & `Frontend`.

> The challenge does not explicitly require a frontend, however I've decided to add it anyway as an extra learning experience for myself.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tech used

-   `Smart Contracts`:
    -   Solidity - _Smart Contracts_
    -   ETH-Brownie - _Development Framework_
-   `Frontend`
    -   React - _UI Framework_
    -   Ethers.js - _Web3 Library_

## ü§î Thought Process

Below is the thought process I took, and the way I decided to solve the challenge.
<a name="b"></a>

### Smart Contracts

As far as the description goes, only one contract is required, which is `ETHPool`.

It should allow:

-   (Public) Deposit _ETH_ staking.
-   (Public) Withdraw staked _ETH_.
-   (Public) Claim accumulated _ETH_ rewards.
-   (Public) Claim&Withdraw combined method.

--

-   (Owner) Deposit _ETH_ rewards.

--

-   (Read) Check user's staked _ETH_ balance.
-   (Read) Check contract's _ETH_ balance.

The reward system must:

-   Only transfer the _ETH_ rewards to the user when they claim it.
-   Reward calculation only takes into account the users in the pool at the time it is deposited by the owner.
-   More?

### The Problem: Efficiency

<a name="efficiency"></a>

It is easy and intuitive to come up with a straight-forward solution that's able to distribute the rewards proportionally between all of the pool's participants whenever the rewards are deposited.

However, _in my opinion_, doing this would not be elegant at all, as it would require looping through all users and calculate their share every single time. In general - though specially in a blockchain context - this would make the transaction considerably **expensive** in terms of computational power, and **not scalable** as it would only get worse the more users are involved.

This is why I've opted to look for an alternative to try and solve this in a much more efficient way.

### Proposed Solution

> ### Domain Assumptions
>
> -   **ERC-20 Reward Token**: For the sake of making it slightly more interesting, I've decided to make the reward token an ERC-20 instead of just ETH.
